// JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set, and you can use any Unicode characters in strings and comments.

// Some computer hardware and software cannot display, input, or correctly process the full set of Unicode characters. To support programmers and systems using older technology, JavaScript defines escape sequences that allow us to write Unicode characters using only ASCII characters.
